# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This repo is a SPA website for a hair salon. It utilizes React, Vite, and Tailwind to achieve a sleek, modern responsive web application that is also mobile-friendly. The original website here --> [https://www.crownednaturally.com/] will be used as a template.
